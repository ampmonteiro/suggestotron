# Chapter 9 - Autoloading

In each of our files we have these repetetive `require './src/TopicData.php';` lines. 

What if we could get rid of them?

## Goals

- Make our code simpler, and easier to write, using autoloading
- Use custom Autoloader 
- Use a recommend Autoloader ( composer ) 

## Steps

- Step 1:

    An autoloader is just a simple function that will automatically find and load a class based on its name

    We will place our autoloader in `src/Autoloader.php`:

    ```php

        namespace App;

        class Autoloader
        {
            public function load($className)
            {
                $file = __DIR__  . "/" . str_replace("\\", "/", $className) . '.php';

                # App should be associated to src
                # so no need App in the path to be required
                $file = str_replace('App/', '', $file);

                if (file_exists($file)) {
                    require $file;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }

            public function register()
            {
                spl_autoload_register([$this, 'load']);
            }
        }

        $loader = new Autoloader();
        $loader->register();
    ```

- Step 2: 

    We can replace all our other require statements, with a single require for the autoloader itself:

    `require './src/TopicData.php';` 
    
    into:

    `require './src/Autoloader.php';`

    Make this change in `index.php`, `create.php`, `edit.php` and `delete.php` by replacing 

- Step 3:

    Since we have our autoloader in need to make a changes also in
    `helpers` file, where functions `render` and `view` dont need the require:

    ```php

        ....

        function render($view, $data = [], $layout = '')
        {
            (new \App\Core\ViewEngine($view))
                ->render(
                    $data,
                    $layout
                );
        }

        ....

        function view($currentView)
        {
            return new \App\Core\ViewEngine($currentView);
        }

    ```

    Now everything will work without a problem.

- Step 3:

    This autoloader is as simple as possible, but will not handle every situation.

    So nowadays it is standard to use a tool call [composer](https://getcomposer.org/,  'composer - website').

    That beside manage external dependency (like libraries or framework), allow to autoload our internal classes in any cases and even load simple files ( like our `helpers` file).

    So to make ou code even more clean, download [composer](https://getcomposer.org/,  'composer - website'), in which is available in OS.

    If you are using docker, with my configuration, then it is already installed in the container. Just use the `dev container` extension and put in terminal `composer`, which will confirm the installation.


- step 4:

    To start composer need a file called: `composer.json`, in root of project, in level of `views` and `src`, with following definition:

    ```json
        {
            "autoload": {
                "psr-4": {
                    "App\\": "src/"
                },
                "files": [
                    "src/Core/helpers.php"
                ]
            }
        }
    ```

    Notes:
    
    1. between curly indicate that we want autoload our internal dependicies by add key `"autoload"`
    2. the type of loader config, in this case base on `psr-4` standard
    3. indicate the location of the classes and map with respective namespace `App` to `src` folder
    4. Last, another advantages of composer is also autoload not only classes but also files that contains simple functions, for that was add new key call `"files"`, with respetive location.

    More details about it here:

    - [basics](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading 'Autoloading - the basics')

    - [autoload - scheme](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload  "scheme - autoload")

- step 5:

    For this to work  is it need tell the composer generate the configuration inside of composer.json, into terminal the following command:

    ```
        composer dump-autoload
    ```

    With this command a `vendor` folder will be created.

    Note: if you are using `git`, created or add into `.gitignore` file `vendor/`, to avoid to commit and being send to repo, since can be a big problemic due to vendor size.


- Step 5:

    similar to step 2, remove all require and replace it, with:

    `require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';`

    Make this change in `index.php`, `create.php`, `edit.php` and `delete.php`.

    All because, beside of loading classes we are load helpers file, so no need to require it.

    So for example the `index.php`  file would be:

    ```php

        require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

        $topics = new \App\TopicData();

        $result = $topics->getAllTopics();

        $title = 'List of Topics';

        // render(
        //     'index',
        //     compact('title', 'result'),
        //     'base'
        // );

        view('index')
            ->render(
                compact('title', 'result'),
                'base'
            );

    ```

And folders struture so far would be:

  ![edit topic](ch10_struture.png 'var_dump topic')

## Explanation

By adding a layout with views, we can easily make our sites styles consistent. Additionally, we stop ourselves from repeating the same HTML code everywhere, and can change it in one place and effect all of our pages at once!

Also was presented other ways to improve our ViewEngine class to avoid repetion and that allow clean code.
