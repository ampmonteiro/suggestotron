# Chapter 11 - Simple configuration files

## Goals

- Create a simple, global, configuration file to allow you to easily customize your application.

A configuration file is critical for allowing you to do things like moving your site between servers.

## Steps

- Step 1:

  we will create our \Suggestotron\Config class in `src/Core/Config.php`:

  ```php

      namespace App\Core;

      class Config
      {

          public static  $config = [];

          public static function get($config)
          {
              $config = strtolower($config);

              static::$config[$config]  = require __DIR__ . "/../config/{$config}.php";

              return static::$config[$config];

          }
      }

  ```

- Step 2:

  You should avoid put credentials or other sensible data directly in file such as `TopicData`-

  So for this we will create first a folder call `config`, inside of `src` folder, at same level of `Core` folder.

- Step 3:
  Inside of `config` folder, create database.php file with following code:

  ```php

      <?php

      return [
          "username" => null,
          "password" => null,
          "hostname" => null,
          "dbname"   => null,
          "drive"    => null
      ];

  ```

  Note:

  1. if your using git or even not using git, do not backup this file.
  2. when using git added to .gitignore: `src/config/database.php`, and create a file like \_database the similar code without the values.
  3. It ok for learning purposes to be defined like this, but this file should also be outside even of this project folder, as alternative you could add another required to load an external file.

- Step 4:

  Next just changed the `TopicData` to:

  ```php

      namespace App;

      use App\Core\Config;

      class TopicData
      {
          protected $connection = null;
          // localhost or ip address if you are using docker
          // if you used docker then put dev or root otherwise
          protected $user   = null;
          // password defined on container or on the tool
          protected $pwd    = null;
          protected $dsn    = null;

          public function __construct()
          {
              $config = Config::get('database');

              $this->user = $config['username'];

              $this->pwd = $config['password'];

              $this->dsn = "{$config['drive']}:host={$config['hostname']};dbname={$config['dbname']}";

              $this->connect();
          }

          private function connect()
          {
              $this->connection = new \PDO(
                  $this->dsn,
                  $this->user,
                  $this->pwd
              );
          }

          ....
      }
  ```

  Note:

  1. only properties was changes as well this two methods: `__construct` and `connect`.
  2. to indicate the correct namespace of Config, as alternative to `use App\Core\Config;` after namespace, you could use directly ` \App\Core\Config::get('database');`. When 'import' several classes, instead of indicate full namespace, it is recommend to use the `use` way.
  3. Dont forget to add the credential that was in `topicData` into `database` in `config` folder
  4. to the `drive` key, if using mysql or mariadb, you put mysql as the value.

- Step 5:

  Now any time you change the DB credentials, just change that file.

  Or even if want other static configs just create new file into `config` folder and load it with `Config` class, similar to `TopicData` class.
