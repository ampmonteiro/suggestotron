# Chapter 13 - Pretty URLs (With a router)

## Goals

- Get rid of the unsightly ".php" in our URLs, modernizing our app!
- Reduce duplication of code
- Create a simple router
- learn configuration for Apache server (Apache Http)

Modern web applications use magical URLs that don't map 1:1 with files, to make them more dynamic and maintainable.

Note:

    Different web servers (e.g. Nginx, Apache) must be configured differently for this to work, but the most popular ones all support it.

## Dynamic URLs

By default with our PHP server, if we enter a URL that does not exist, we are sent to `index.php`.

We can then look at the `$_SERVER` super-global to find out the page they requested.

This value lives in `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` .

For example, if we visit `localhost/create`, `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI]` is set to /create

## Steps

- Step 1:

  We will start by creating a `Router` class into `Core` folder. This will take the dynamic URL and map it to our application code:

  ```php

  namespace App\Core;

  class Router
  {
      public function start($route)
      {
          $path = realpath("./src/topics/{$route}.php");

          if (file_exists($path)) {
              require $path;
              exit;
          }

          die('Not FOUND');
      }
  }

  ```

- Step 2:

  Now we need to re-purpose our `index.php`, that is at same level or `src` folder to use our router.

  For this, create create a `topics` folder inside src and then create `index.php` with code:

  ```php

      $topics = new \App\TopicData();

      $result = $topics->getAllTopics();

      $title = 'List of Topics';

      view('index')
          ->render(
              compact('title', 'result'),
              'base'
          );
  ```

- step 3:

  Then, we can make the necessary changes to our `index.php`:

  ```php

        require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

        use App\Core\Router;

        $route = explode('?', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])[0] ?? '';

        if (empty($route) || $route === '/') {
            $route = 'index';
        }

        $route = trim(str_replace('/', '', $route));

        // $router = new  Router;
        // $router->start($route);
        // or, since call only one method

        (new Router)->start($route);
  ```

  to understand the `$_SERVER` superglobal just do

        die(print_r($_SERVER));

  We remove the query by spliting by `?`.

  Verify if exist a route defined or not.

  Then is removed the foreslashes.

- step 4:

  Now should do the same as index ( with list) and move each page in `topics` folder, inside `src` folder:

  So create `create.php`, `edit.php`, `delete.php` and copy the respetive code.

  Dont forget to remove the following line:

        require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

  Because already exist in `index.php` at same level of `src` and `views` folders.

  Then remove remove the `create`, `delete` and `edit` folder that are in same level of `views` folder.

  With this pretty url it is done by our route instead by file system, so this wy the need to remove those folders.

- step 5:

  For ou router to work you need to tell ou server (in this Apache http server) to not use file system but to point out all request to `index.php` (responsible for calling the router).

  So it is needed a configuration file, at same level of that `index.php` file, specific for Apache server call `.htaccess` with this configuration:

  ```
      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
      RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
  ```

  Note:

  for this to work on an Apache server, it need that mod rewrite module is active, which is in case of this docker container and dont need to worry because also in all hosting service with this server this also active by default, you just need the .htaccess file.

## Explanation

This kind way to have pretty URLs is recommend for complex websites or application and it is what all php frameworks do, by using a router for clean url, with config file for the server.

By programmitically handling our URLs, we can create pretty URLs in any structure we want, without needing to create complex directory structures.

This allows us to share common code between many pages — similiar to our templates — and reduce our applications complexity.
