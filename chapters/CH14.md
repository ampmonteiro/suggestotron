# Chapter 14 - DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself

As developers we try not to repeat ourselves. As you've seen, doing similar things multiple times, means that we have update multiple places when we want to make changes.

By trying to be more DRY, we reduce the number of places where changes need to be made.

## Goals

- Make our code more DRY by combining similar functionality

- Introducing Controllers

- clean up index.php

controllers:

    a special class for containing functionality relating to a specific thing — like Topics.

## Steps

- Step 1:

  Our controller — which could be one of many — will live in the class:

        \src\Controllers\Topics

and will have one method for each action (index, create, edit, delete) that our application has:

```php

    <?php

    namespace App\Controllers;

    class Topics
    {
        public function index()
        {
        }

        public function create()
        {
        }

        public function edit()
        {
        }

        public function delete()
        {
        }
    }
```

- Step 2:

  Next, we can migrate the contents of our .php files that are in `\src\topics` to their respective methods in `\src\Controllers\Topics`.

  For example, the `index` would look like this:

  ```php

    namespace App\Controllers;

        class Topics
        {
            public function index()
            {
                $topics = new \App\TopicData();

                $result = $topics->getAllTopics();

                $title = 'List of Topics';

                view('index')
                    ->render(
                        compact('title', 'result'),
                        'base'
                    );
            }

            ....

        }

  ```

  Our router will call these methods, instead of including our .php files that are in `src\topics` folder.

- Step 3:

  Once you have completed all the methods, you will notice there is a lot of repeated code, specifically:

  ` new \App\TopicData()`

  To avoid this kind of repetion, you can move this line to their own method and assign the objects to properties.

  Because all of our actions need this, we can do it automatically in the special `__construct()` method:

  - Step 4:

  To use our controller, we just update our router:

  ```php

    <?php

    namespace App\Core;

    use App\Controllers\Topics;

    class Router
    {
        public function start($route)
        {

            $controller = new Topics();

            $method = [$controller, $route];

            if (!is_callable($method)) {
                die('Not FOUND');
            }

            return $method();
        }
    }

  ```

- Step 4:

  Finally, if you didn't already, you can remove the `topics` folder that are in `\src\topics`

- Step 5:

  We can clean up more the main index.php by put only:

  ```php

      <?php

      require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

      use App\Core\Router;

      // $router = new  Router;
      // $router->start($route);
      // or, since call only one method

      (new Router)
          ->start($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);

  ```

- Step 6:

  For this to work, we need to change the `Router` class to:

  ```php

      <?php

      namespace App\Core;

      use App\Controllers\Topics;

      class Router
      {
          public function start($currentURI)
          {
              $route = $this->getRoute($currentURI);

              $controller = new Topics();

              $method = [$controller, $route];

              if (!is_callable($method)) {
                  die('Not FOUND');
              }

              return $method();
          }

          protected function getRoute($uri)
          {
              $route = explode('?', $uri)[0] ?? '';

              if (empty($route) || $route === '/') {
                  $route = 'index';
              }

              return trim(str_replace('/', '', $route));
          }
      }
  ```

## Explanation

By implementing a Controller we have further simplified our code. It should be a goal to keep your code as simple as possible: Future you will thank you.
