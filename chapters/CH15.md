# Chapter 15 - Multiple Controllers

As our application grows, we can continue to add more actions to our `\src\Controller\Topics` controller but this would make it harder to maintain.

To help our future selves, we should allow for us to separate our features in to multiple controllers.

This means our router needs to be able to tell which controller is being requested, and to call the correct one.

## Goals

- Allow our app to grow using multiple controllers

- Automatically route to controllers and actions

- Allow easy setup of routes via configuration

## Steps

- Step 1:

    We are going to start with the configuration as it will determine how our code needs to work.

    Our configuration needs to determine several things:

        The URL to match
        The default action, if none is specified
        The default controller, if none is specified
        An error controller for when an error is encountered

    Our configuration file, routes.php ( file to create in `src/config`), might look like this:

    ```php
        <?php

        use App\Controllers\Error;
        use App\Controllers\Topics;

        return [
            ''       => [Topics::class, 'index'],
            'create' => [Topics::class, 'create'],
            'edit'   => [Topics::class, 'edit'],
            'delete' => [Topics::class, 'delete'],
            'error'  => [Error::class, 'index']
        ];
    ```

    Here we have defined four routes.

    In our first route, `''`, if a user browses to only `localhost`, will show the list / index of topics.

    In our second route, `'create'`, if a user browses to only `localhost/create`, to create the create topics.

- Step 2:

  Now that we have our config, we can use it to update our `Router` class by adding contruct method:

  ```php

        <?php

        namespace App\Core;

        use App\Core\Config;

        class Router
        {
                protected  $configRoutes;
                protected  $params = [];

                public function __construct()
                {
                    $this->configRoutes = Config::get('routes');
                }

                ....
        }

  ```

  Note that was added also `use App\Core\Config;` to load config class.

- Step 3:

  We need to update our `getRoute` method in `Router` class like:

  ```php

      class Router
      {
          ....

              protected function getRoute($uri)
              {
                  $route = parse_url($uri);

                  if (!empty($route['query'])) {
                      $query_params = explode('&', $route['query']);
                      $rs = [];
                      foreach ($query_params as $value) {

                          $tmp = explode('=', $value);

                          $rs[$tmp[0]] = $tmp[1];
                      }

                      $this->params = $rs;
                  }

                      return  str_replace('/', '', $route['path']);
                  }
      }
  ```

  Where is used the `parse_url` function to simplified the separation between what comes with URL,
  which can get an array with key like `path` ( url without query string) and `query` ( url with only query string if any).

  if verified the query string, in case of some, they are added to params property.

  Finally the `/` is removed from current path.

- step 4:

  Next we need to match with controller with current route, where a `getController` method is added into `Router` class:

  ```php

    class Router
    {
        ....

          protected function getController($route)
          {
              if (!array_key_exists($route, $this->configRoutes)) {
                  $this->error('404');
              }

              $controller_ar  = $this->configRoutes[$route];

              $action = [new $controller_ar[0], $controller_ar[1]];

              if (is_callable($action)) {
                  return $action;
              }
          }
    }

  ```

  So receives the route, verified if exist in the configuration.

  In case if existing, will instantiate the defined class that store in first position of the array of configuration.

  Then is verified if that can be executed by using the `is_callable` function.

- step 5:

  Next we need to create the `error` method, that can be called in the `getController` in case of error:

  ```php

      class Router
      {
            ....

            protected function error($code)
            {
                if (!array_key_exists('error', $this->configRoutes)) {
                    http_response_code(500);
                    die('An unknown error occurred, please try again!');
                }

                $this->start("error?code={$code}");
                exit;
            }
      }

  ```

  With this method, an error route can be called if it was defined in the configuration.

- step 6:

  Now we need to create `Error` class, to the `error` route defined in the configuration routes file.

  In controllers folder:

  ```php
      <?php

      namespace App\Controllers;

      class Error
      {
          public function index($options = [])
          {
              $data = [
                  'code' => 500,
                  'msg' => 'An unknown error occurred. Try later.',
                  'title' => 'Server Error !!!'
              ];

              if (sizeof($options) === 0) {
                  http_response_code(500);

                  render('errors/index', $data, 'base');
                  exit;
              }

              http_response_code($options['code']);

              $data = [
                  'code' => $options['code'],
                  'msg' => 'Page not Found',
                  'title' => 'Page Not Found !!!'
              ];

              render('errors/index', $data, 'base');
          }
      }
  ```

  In case of no `$options` will show 500 error. Next the view.

- step 6:

    For the previous controller we need to create an error view as `view/error/index.view.php` like:

    ```php

    <main class="grid place-content-center">
        <p class="text-red-500 text-8xl">
            <?= $code ?>
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-9 text-2xl">
            <?= $msg ?>
        </p>
    </main>

    ```

- step 7:

  Again in the `Router class`, it is needed to update the `start` method:

  ```php

    class Router
    {
        ....
            public function start($currentURI)
            {
                $route =  $this->getRoute($currentURI);

                $action = $this->getController($route);

                return $action($this->params);
            }
        ....
    }

  ```

## Explanation

By adding the ability for multiple controllers, we have given ourselves a structure in to which we can continue to add new features to our application easily.

All this without change the url of the views for Topics a related hyperlinks.

In this case beside of show Topics, if no page found `error` route is executed with respetive controller and view.

And no need to use the `$_GET` super global to get the id since the router will passed by, with options params.
