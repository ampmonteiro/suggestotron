# Chapter 16 - Introducing Models

A model is just a fancy name for a class that specifically encapsulates all functionality related to a thing, e.g. topics, votes, or users.

Our \src\TopicData class, is an example of a model class.


## Managing Database Connections

Currently, we create the database connection every time we instantiate \src\TopicData.

However, what if we want multiple instances of the object? What we need the database connection in other models?

We should instead, have a single way to create a single shared connection, that any object can easily re-use.


## Goals

- Refactor our database connection code, so we can re-use the connections in many places

## Steps

- Step 1:

    We are going to create what is known as a singleton class, which is responsible for managing our connection.

    We will call this class with namespace `\App\Core` where you will create the `DB` class in `src/Core/`.

    ```php

        <?php

        namespace App\Core;

        class DB
        {
            static protected $instance = null;

            protected $connection = null;
            
            protected function __construct()
            {
                $config = Config::get('database');

                $dsn = "{$config['drive']}:host={$config['hostname']};dbname={$config['dbname']}";

                try {
                    $this->connection =  new \PDO(
                        $dsn,
                        $config['username'],
                        $config['password']
                    );
                } catch (\PDOException $e) {
                    throw new \PDOException($e->getMessage(), (int)$e->getCode());
                }
            }

            public function getConnection()
            {
                return $this->connection;
            }

            static public function getInstance()
            {
                if (!(static::$instance instanceof static)) {
                    static::$instance = new static();
                }

                return static::$instance->getConnection();
            }
        }

    ```

This class sets `__construct()` to protected, which means that it cannot be instantiated outside of this class (or it's children) and therefore requires the use of `\App\Core\DB::getInstance()` to create a new object.

`\App\Core\DB::getInstance()` will check for an existing copy and return that instead if one exists. Otherwise, it creates and stores a new instance.

- step 2:

    In `TopicData` class remove `$user, $pwd` and `$dsn` properties

    Replace also  `use App\Core\Config;` with `use App\Core\DB;`  

    In `__construct` can be clean up with only following code:

    ```php

        <?php

        namespace App;

        use App\Core\DB;

        class TopicData
        {
            protected $connection = null;

            public function __construct()
            {
                $this->connection = DB::getInstance();
            }
            
            ....
            }
    ```

    Also the `connect` can be removed.

- step 3:

    To better organize our code, we're going to rename our `TopicData` class (in src/) a class to identify it as a model, in the same way we do controllers. Therefore, it will be called `\App\Models\Topic`, which should be moved to `Models` folder with replaced namespace:

    ```php

        <?php

        namespace App\Models;

        use App\Core\DB;

        class Topic
        {
            ...
        }

    ```

    Finally, update our `\App\Controllers\Topics` ( means src/Controllers/Topics) to use our renamed class:

    ```php

        <?php

        namespace App\Controllers;

        class Topics
        {
            protected $data;

            public function __construct()
            {
                $this->data = new \App\Models\Topic();
            }

            ....
        }
    ```

## Explanation

You can now access the database connection from anywhere using `\App\Core\DB::getInstance()`.

Which can be used in any controller.

Better organization with Models and and DB specific to connect to database.
