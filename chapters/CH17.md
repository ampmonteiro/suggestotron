# Chapter 17 - Completing Suggestron features

Suggestron is not really complete unless we can rank suggestions by popular vote.

We're going to use all of the new skills we've learned, to build out this new feature.

## Goals

- Add voting to Suggestotron

## Steps

- Step 1:

  Just like with our topics, we will start out by defining our database table, votes:

  ![Votes table](votes_table.png 'Votes view ')

  To get the table create firts open your SQL ide or other tools alike mention on chapter 2.

- step 2:

  Create the table with following code:

  ```sql

      USE suggestron;

      CREATE TABLE votes (
          id INT unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          topic_id INT unsigned NOT NULL,
          count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
          PRIMARY KEY(id)
      );
  ```

- Step 3:

  Create empty vote records for each of your existing topics:

  ```sql

      USE suggestron;

      INSERT INTO votes (
          topic_id,
          count
      ) SELECT id, 0 FROM topics;

  ```

  to verify our data:

  ```sql

      USE suggestron;

      SELECT * FROM votes;
  ```

  Approximate expected result:

  ![votes insterted](inserted_votes.png 'Votes added with zero')

  show for each topic has id associated as well as voted initialized to zero

- step 4:

  We now need a model class to manage our votes, \App\Models\Vote (in src/Models), as `Votes.php` file, with respetives methods that allow create, update and delete vote assotiated to a topic.

  ```php

      <?php

      namespace App\Models;

      use App\Core\DB;

      class Vote
      {
          protected $connection = null;

          public function __construct()
          {
              $this->connection = DB::getInstance();
          }

          public function create($topicId)
          {
              $sql = "INSERT INTO votes (topic_id, count)
                          VALUES
                          (:id, 0)";

              $query = $this->connection->prepare($sql);

              return $query->execute([
                  ':id' => $topicId
              ]);
          }

          public function update($topicId)
          {
              $sql = "UPDATE votes
                      SET count = count + 1
                      WHERE topic_id = :id";

              $query = $this->connection->prepare($sql);

              return $query->execute([
                  ':id' => $topicId,
              ]);
          }

          public function delete($topicId)
          {
              $sql = "DELETE FROM votes
                      WHERE topic_id = :id";

              $query = $this->connection->prepare($sql);

              return $query->execute([
                  ':id' => $topicId,
              ]);
          }
      }

  ```

- step 5:

  We need to update the `Topic` model to be able to initialize a vote and delete the associate vote,

  ```php

      <?php

      namespace App\Models;

      use App\Core\DB;

      class Topic
      {

        ....

        public function create($data)
        {
            $sql = "INSERT INTO topics
                                (
                                    title,
                                    description
                                )
                    VALUES (
                            :title,
                            :description
                            )";

            $query = $this->connection->prepare($sql);

            $query->execute([
                ':title'       => $data['title'],
                ':description' => $data['description']
            ]);

            $lastId = $this->connection->lastInsertId();

            (new Vote())->create($lastId);
        }

        ....

        public function delete($id)
        {
            $query = $this->connection->prepare(
                " DELETE FROM topics
                    WHERE id = :id
                "
            );

            $rs =  $query->execute([
                ':id' => $id,
            ]);

            if (!$rs) {
                return false;
            }

            return (new Vote())->delete($id);
        }

      }

  ```

  Here the create and delete methods instantiate `Vote` model and call the respetives methods

- step 6:

  Yet in Topic model we need to update the `getAllTopics`, to both retrieve the votes for each topic also rename the method to `all`:

  ```php

      <?php

      namespace App\Models;

      use App\Core\DB;

      class Topic
      {

        ....

            public function all()
            {
                $sql = "SELECT  T.*,
                                V.count
                        FROM topics T
                        INNER JOIN votes V ON  V.topic_id = T.id";

                $query = $this->connection->prepare($sql);
                $query->execute();

                return $query;
            }

        ....

      }
  ```

  Also rename the `getTopic` method to `find`, with this all method are called with single word.

  Now you to the page where is the list of topics, you will see ordered by votes and title.

  Since for now does not exist votes, the topics will be order by title ASC ( since A letter to Z);

  Note:

        dont forget to update the Topics controller with replaced methods of the model.

- step 7:

  Next up, we create our controller, \App\Controllers\Votes (in src/Controllers/), with an `update` action:

  ```php

      <?php

      namespace App\Controllers;

      use App\Models\Vote;

      class Votes
      {
          protected $model;

          public function __construct()
          {
              $this->model = new Vote();
          }

          public function update($options)
          {
              if (!isset($options['id']) || empty($options['id'])) {
                  echo "No topic id specified!";
                  exit;
              }

              $this->model->update($options['id']);;

              header("Location: /");
          }
      }
  ```

  note: to be similar to Votes controller, replace `$data` property for `$model` property.

- step 8:

  To access our new controller, we should add a route to config/routes.php:

  ```php

      <?php

      use App\Controllers\Error;
      use App\Controllers\Topics;
      use App\Controllers\Votes;

      return [
          ''       => [Topics::class, 'index'],
          'create' => [Topics::class, 'create'],
          'edit'   => [Topics::class, 'edit'],
          'delete' => [Topics::class, 'delete'],
          'vote'   => [Votes::class,  'update'],
          'error'  => [Error::class,  'index']
      ];

  ```

  when URL match with word `vote`, then will call Votes controller and execute update method.

- step 9:

  To allow our users to actually vote, we'll add a button to our `index.view` responsible to list topics, index/list.phtml, before our Edit and Delete buttons:

  ```html
  <p class="self-end flex gap-5 my-3 ">
    <a
      class="py-3 px-5 rounded-md font-bold text-blue-50 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-stone-700"
      href="/vote/?id=<?= $item['id'] ?>"
    >
      <strong>
        <?= $item['count'] ?? 0 ?>
      </strong>
    </a>
    <a
      class="p-3 rounded-md font-bold text-gray-50 bg-stone-500 hover:bg-stone-700"
      href="/edit/?id=<?= $item['id'] ?>"
    >
      Edit
    </a>
    <a
      class="p-3 rounded-md font-bold text-gray-50 bg-rose-500 hover:bg-rose-700"
      href="/delete/?id=<?= $item['id'] ?>"
    >
      Delete
    </a>
  </p>
  ```

## Explanation

With with all features related to Topics are finished.

Next chapters It is about modern feature of PHP that can be implemented into the App.

And also another improvement related to the router and security.
